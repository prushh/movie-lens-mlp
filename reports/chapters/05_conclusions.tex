\chapter{Conlusions}
In order to predict the average rating of a film, the required analysis pipeline was implemented:
\begin{center}
    Data Acquisition $\rightarrow$ Data Pre-Processing $+$ Visualization $\rightarrow$ Modeling $\rightarrow$ \\ $\rightarrow$ Performance Analysis $+$ Visualization
\end{center}
As a result of the performance analysis, it was seen that SVM and MovieNet (MLP) performed better than the other models considered, thus succeeding in predicting the class to which a film belongs.

\section{Future works}
% Parallelizzazione parte di preprocessing (Dask)
% Studio pi√π approfondito di feature e tecniche di balancing
