\chapter{Methodology}
In the next chapter there will be the explaination of the data pipeline that the project followed. In particular, each subsection will focus on a specific phase of this pipeline, exept for the data visualization, that has been used only when needed.
\section{Data Acquisition}
The used datasets are downloaded at run-time directly from the sources. These datasets came from directly from MovieLens' page, which provides 6 different dataset that are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ratings.csv
    \item tags.csv
    \item movies.csv
    \item links.csv
    \item genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv
\end{itemize}
where the most of these datasets provides information for approximately 60000 samples. Since the links dataset provides an identifier to the IMDB and TMDB databases it has been possibile to gather more information from these external sources throught their API\cite{API-TMDB}\cite{API-IMDB}.
